# MintGate
**Overview of how MintGate used the protocol:**

MintGate is a project that launched through the Gitcoin Kernel launchpad.
MintGate noticed that social communities are limited and believed that giving gate access to NFT holders,  hence the token now has utility due to aceess.

NFTs also help add functional value where creators can trade an NFT and have a buyer purchase for a higher price to help incentivize the creator to grow.

Along the way to solving this problem MintGate did their due diligence of Research & Development before choosing Rarible as Marketplace for their growing community of creatrors and influencers.

**How MintGate would have changed things knowing what they know now:**

One thing Mintgate would have done differently based on experience is that they would have implemented adding a maketplace infastructure to their project sooner. 

Also, they aim to have more of a SDK infastructure because API's tend to fail from time to time and using SDK's would prove to be more reliable.  

**Step by step instructions for teams to do the same:**

API's for MintGate are available for token gating to integrate into any project. 

Full documentation and instructions can be found here:
[MintGate Docs](https://mintgate.gitbook.io/mintgate-docs/)

Currently, the MintGate team is working on API wrappers that tie-in to the Rarible Protocol endpoints and future projections are to create a subgraph to reach full decentralization.

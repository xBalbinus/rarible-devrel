# CoCoNFT
**TLDR:**

CoCo NFT helps new creators get into the NFT space by building an onRamp that makes it easy to manage your wallet via social media logins. 

CoCoNFT uses the following Smart Contract functionalities:  lazy minting, exchange, and indexer.

CoCoNFT uses lazy minting so that the creators dont have to pay for minting making the process easy for newbies to crypto. We are planning on using the ability to support checkout right on our website via the Rarible Protocol Exchange and the indexer I believe to show a user's Lazy Minted NFTs.

**How CocoNFT would have changed things knowing what they know now:**

On the Protocol we developed code to handle many features that we needed Rarible Protocol to do. Instead of waiting for the protocol updates.

As we were building found alot of frameworks we would have used something like Starter App to jumpstart our development process.

In regards to the database side CocoNFT advises to understand how you structure your database. 

**Step by step instructions for teams to do the same:**

Working on API and/or SDK is in the works.
